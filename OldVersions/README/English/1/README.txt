## 2024

### April 10th

#### Windows XP has been officially discontinued for 10 years

Today (2024, April 10th) marks the 10 year anniversary of the discontinuation of Windows XP (2014, April 10th) Windows XP was a historic operating system. Although one variant of Windows XP has been discontinued for 10 years, some other editions continued to receive official support until 2019, and also some patches until 2020 (notably for the WannaCrypt ransomware) despite being discontinued for years, it is still used heavily outside of virtual machines, with millions of computers (even in critical areas like hospitals and airports) still using the operating system. It is still nowhere near where it once was (above 50% marketshare) but it still remains a total marketshare of about 1% for desktop computers.

It is safer to run Windows XP in a virtual machine. It isn't possible for all old software to run this way, due to anti-VM code, and difficulties communicating with the host and guest systems on complex software and macvhinery. Unfortunately, many are still using a system with known vulnerabilities.

Windows XP had a very iconic and nostalgic user interface, but you don't have to say goodbye to it. You can still freely use Windows XP in a virtual machine, on an old computer (preferrably with Wi-Fi/other Internet connections turned off) or even a desktop theme.

Windows XP is still great for some old video games.

Windows XP is abandonware at this point, like Windows 95 or Windows 98 (and other old Windows releases) there is now little risk in downloading it. Activating it remains an issue, due to the activation servers being down. Registry hacks are the way to go.
